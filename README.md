Challenges are located in challenges/

Each challenge folder contains a Makefile which can be used to re-build the challenge binary. Running `make` will execute the re-build and allow you to inspect the various compiler warnings.

gdb is also provided as well as pwntools to help in your exploit development and debugging efforts.
